📚 Q&A Section

1. What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?

getElementById(id) → Selects a single element by unique id. Returns only one element.

getElementsByClassName(class) → Selects multiple elements with the same class. Returns an HTMLCollection (live).

querySelector(selector) → Selects the first matching element using CSS selectors (#id, .class, tag).

querySelectorAll(selector) → Selects all matching elements using CSS selectors. Returns a NodeList (static).

2. How do you create and insert a new element into the DOM?
   let newDiv = document.createElement("div");  
   newDiv.textContent = "Hello World";  
   document.body.appendChild(newDiv);

createElement() → creates a new element.

textContent → adds text.

appendChild() → inserts it into DOM.

3. What is Event Bubbling and how does it work?

Event bubbling means when an event occurs on an element, it first runs on the target element and then bubbles up to its parent, grandparent, until reaching document.

Example: Clicking a button inside a div triggers both the button’s event and the parent div’s event unless stopped.

4. What is Event Delegation in JavaScript? Why is it useful?

Event delegation is attaching a single event listener to a parent element instead of multiple child elements.

Useful because it reduces memory usage and works for dynamically created elements.

Example:

document.querySelector("#list").addEventListener("click", (e) => {
if (e.target.tagName === "LI") {
console.log("List item clicked:", e.target.textContent);
}
});

5. What is the difference between preventDefault() and stopPropagation()?

preventDefault() → Prevents default browser action (e.g., form submission, link navigation).

stopPropagation() → Stops the event from bubbling up to parent elements.
